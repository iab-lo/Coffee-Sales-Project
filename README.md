# Coffee Sales Excel Project
This is a guided project by Youtuber, Mo Chen, using Excel. After creating a dashboard designed by Mo, I made my own dashboard inspired by the data. I attached the excel sheet which users can interact with and view coffee sales.

## Key Learnings
- Performed X-Lookup and Index Match to gather data into one table which will be used to create visualizations.
- Used filters, slicers, and a timeline to help users navigate the dashboard.
- Created bar charts, pie charts with Pivot tables.

## Data Set

Data was provided by Mo Chen in his tutorial. It contained 3 sheets: Orders, Customers, and Products.

## Dashboard

## Summary
- Present the coffee sales for each coffee type within United States.
- Compare which coffee was most purchased within a certain time period
- Show our top customers and potentially communicate with them to improve our sales.
